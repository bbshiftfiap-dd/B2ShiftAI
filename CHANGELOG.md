```bash
# Solution: Check GCP credentials and permissions
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

**Issue**: "BigQuery access denied"
```bash
# Solution: Verify IAM roles
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="user:YOUR_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/bigquery.admin"
```

**Issue**: "Clustering results differ from v1.x"
```bash
# Solution: This is expected due to algorithm improvements
# Run validation script to compare business insights
